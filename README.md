# Introduction
Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that involves filling in a grid of numbers so that each row, column and sub-grid contains all the digits from 1 to 9. Solving Sudoku puzzles requires logical reasoning and deduction skills. In this project, we will develop a Sudoku solver application using Java Swing and Apache NetBeans IDE.

# Project Description
The Sudoku solver application will allow users to input a Sudoku puzzle and solve it automatically. The user interface will be developed using Java Swing, which provides a rich set of GUI components for building desktop applications. The Apache NetBeans IDE will be used for developing and debugging the application.

The user interface of the Sudoku solver application will consist of a grid of cells where the user can input the initial numbers of the puzzle. Once the puzzle is loaded, the user can click the "Solve" button to invoke the solver algorithm. The application will display the solution if one exists, or an error message if no solution is found.

# Project Features
The Sudoku solver application will have the following features:
Graphical user interface using Java Swing
Input validation to ensure that the user input is valid Sudoku puzzle
Solution validation to ensure that the solution is correct
Reaet puzzle

# Conclusion
Developing a Sudoku solver application using Java Swing and Apache NetBeans IDE is an interesting project that will test your programming skills. The project requires knowledge of Java programming, GUI development using Java Swing, and algorithm design. By completing this project, you will have gained valuable experience in building desktop applications and solving complex problems using algorithms.
